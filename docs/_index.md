This packages brings message buses to your Zend Expressive project. Basically it's a bundle of factories to make
life easier for you. The real work is done by [Symfony Messenger](https://github.com/symfony/messenger).

It comes with pre-configured command, event and query buses for your convenience. Or don't use them if you want to
create your own. Transports can be used to queue your messages or send and receive them to/from 3rd parties.
